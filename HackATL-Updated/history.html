        <p>The beginning of HackATL was inspired a group of 5 passionate college students who wanted to bring entrepreneurship to life at Emory University. </p>
        <p>Hosted at Goizueta Business School, HackATL was the first-ever hackathon to be entirely student-run and organized at the university.</p>

        <p>After the major success of the first HackATL, student leaders were motivated to expand the scale of the event. The HackATL logo was rebranded to a more minimalistic and modern design. To expand professional knowledge on starting a business, leading venture capitalists hosted workshops for 400+ students.</p>

        <p>For the first time ever, HackATL introduced the concept of <b>"Categories"</b> to our hackathon. With global climate change at our feet, the U.S. healthcare system in pieces, political unrest around the world, and complacent markets, impactful entrepreneurial solutions are critical. </p>
        <p>Under 3 distinct areas, <b>Consumer Technology, Health & Wellness, and Social Enterprise</b>, the Competition Categories allowed all aspiring entrepreneurs to push their ideas and think more critically about solving the world's most pressing issues. </p>
